	<h2>Interested to know more about me? Here you go...</h2>
    <p>I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Pittsburgh. I am also the secretary of ASA Pittsburgh Student Chapter.
        I originally am from the outskirts of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kolkata,+West+Bengal,+India/@22.6757521,88.0495361,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x39f882db4908f667:0x43e330e68f6c2cbc!8m2!3d22.572646!4d88.363895">Kolkata</a>, West Bengal, India. I came to the US in 2017. 
        Prior to that I used to live in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kanpur,+Uttar+Pradesh,+India/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x399c4770b127c46f:0x1778302a9fbe7b41?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiAm4CKh_7qAhWEZDUKHfRtCZIQ8gEwGXoECBsQBg">Kanpur</a>, Uttar Pradesh, India, while I was getting my Masters degree.
        Fun fact, I spent 11 years of my student life in hostels!
    </p>
    <p> Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya, Narendrapur is my school, where I spent 8 years of my life. 
        It indeed is a lovely place; me and my friends call it our second home! It being a residential school has hostels for all the students, playgrounds for everyone of them and ample greenery. 
        I would encourage you to find out more about my school <a href="https://www.rkmvnarendrapur.org">here</a> . 
        Trust me, you would be surprised by the kind of life kids in my school have.
    </p>
    <p> But, enough about my background. Even though I am pretty much a nerd, I have other interests too. I am an amateur photographer and mostly click landscapes.
        I also like to draw a few scratches on my iPad at times. I have always been interested in music and used to be in the school singing team. 
        Early 2020, I finally got the opportunity and started learning the Guitar. If I had to pick my favorite instrument it would either be flute or sitar.
        Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia and Pt. Ravi Shankar are my favorites and their music bring me peace. 
        Recently, I have grown a massive interest in studying the might sky; so much so that it has thrown my sleeping cycle of the track! But this one merges quite nicely with my interest in photgraphy and I hope to get into astrophotography real soon.
