	<h2>Interested to know more about me?</h2>
    <p align = "justify">I (<em>he/him/his</em>) am currently based in Kolkata, India. I came to the United States in August of 2017 and called Pittsburgh (the city of bridges) home for nearly six years. Prior to that I used to live in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kanpur,+Uttar+Pradesh,+India/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x399c4770b127c46f:0x1778302a9fbe7b41?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiAm4CKh_7qAhWEZDUKHfRtCZIQ8gEwGXoECBsQBg" target="_blank">Kanpur</a>, Uttar Pradesh, India, while I was getting my Masters degree.
        Originally, I am from the outskirts of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kolkata,+West+Bengal,+India/@22.6757521,88.0495361,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x39f882db4908f667:0x43e330e68f6c2cbc!8m2!3d22.572646!4d88.363895" target="_blank">Kolkata</a>, West Bengal, India. 
        I held the position of vice-president of ASA Pittsburgh Student Chapter for 2020-21.
        Fun fact, 10 years of my student life has been spent in hostels!
    </p>
    <p align = "justify"> Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya, Narendrapur is my school, where I spent 8 years of my life. 
        It indeed is a lovely place; me and my friends call it our second home! It being a residential school has hostels for all the students, playgrounds for everyone of them and ample greenery. 
        I encourage you to find out more about my school <a href="https://www.rkmvnarendrapur.org" target="_blank">by clicking here</a> . 
        Trust me, you would be surprised by the kind of life kids in my school lead.
    </p>
    <p align = "justify"> Even though I am pretty much immersed in Statistics all day, I have other interests too. I am an amateur photographer and mostly click landscapes.
        I also like to draw a few scratches on my iPad at times. I have always been interested in music and used to be in the school singing team. 
        If I had to pick my favorite instrument it would either be flute or sitar; I am heavily biased towards Indian classical music.
        Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia, Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Pt. Ravi Shankar are my favorites and their music bring me peace. I find a unique interest in learning about different plotting tools in <em>R</em> and 
        will usually spend a lot time in reading through different articles/blogs on how to enhance plots and eventually fish out seldom used but visually attractive and inclusive (for example using proper colorblind palettes) techniques.
