<p>My first encounter with Wigner’s name was when I was suggested to read the Wigner-Ville distribution and Gabor transform during my brief work on a signal processing project three years back. The project was short and I did not care to make any in-depth venture into Wigner’s work. A couple years after that I had started to read on random matrix perturbations when I started come across terms such as <strong>Wigner matrix</strong>, <strong>Wigner’s surmise</strong>, <strong>Wigner semi-circle law</strong>, and so on. Now this piqued my interest because I had heard of Wigner before. Upon looking up the Wikipedia page I found that Eugene Wigner was a physicist (well, primarily) and a Nobel laureate (1963)! <br />
Only recently I had the pleasure of coming across the <em>The Oxford Handbook of Random Matrix Theory</em>, and I am so very thankful to myself for digging on this subject in our library catalogue. So, as I read along, start to understand the origins and implications  of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) (and get my mind blown), I will continue writing on this. This is such an ocean of knowledge, I will be extremely happy if I can digest even a drop of it.<br /><br />
It is indeed very hard (as a novice) to decide from where to begin. Let me start by defining some matrices and matrix ensembles. Let us say \(\mathbf{Y}\) is an \(n\)-dimensional symmetric matrix with the \((i,j)\)-th entry denoted by \(Y_{ij}\). \(\mathbf{Y}\) is a Wigner matrix if it satisfies the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-size:1.2em">The entries are independent upto symmetry. That is $Y_{ij}$ are independent for all $1 \le i\le j \le n$.</li>
    <li style="font-size:1.2em">The diagonal entries are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and the entries in the lower triangle are also i.i.d and also independent of the diagonal entries.</li>
    <li style="font-size:1.2em">The expected values of he squares of entries are finite, i.e. $\mathbb{E}\left(Y_{ij}^{2}\right) &lt; \infty$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, let us learn about some matrix ensembles.</p>
