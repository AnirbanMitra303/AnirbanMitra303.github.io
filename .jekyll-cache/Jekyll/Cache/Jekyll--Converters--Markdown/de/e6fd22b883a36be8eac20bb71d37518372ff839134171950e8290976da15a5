I"Ü<p>One fine Sunday morning I made a rookie mistake. I was trying to study the properties of conditional distribution of a <strong>Multivariate Normal</strong> distribution, because, although I knew the properties their derivations were a bit rusty. Now, as I said it was Sunday morning and in my defense I was trying to work even though I was exhausted and still half asleep. Turned out that my inadequately rested brain messed up the concepts of <strong>Partial Correlation</strong>, <strong>Partial Covariance</strong> and <strong>Precision Matrices</strong>. So I decided to create this short write-up, so that any reader or my future self with similar dilemma can rectify their misunderstandings. Here goes:<br />
Let \(\mathbf{X} = [X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{p}]^{\top}\) follow a \(p\)-variate Normal distribution with mean \(0\) and a covariance matrix \(\Sigma\). We will assume \(\Sigma\) to be positive definite. Then the <strong>Precision matrix</strong> of \(\mathbf{X}\) is defined as \(\Omega := \Sigma ^{-1}\). Now we know that if we partition \(\mathbf{X} = [\mathbf{X^{(1)}}^{\top},\mathbf{X^{(2)}}^{\top}]^{\top}\), where \(\mathbf{X^{(1)}} = [X_{1},X_{2}]^{\top}\) and \(\mathbf{X^{(2)}} = [X_{3},X_{4},\dots,X_{p}]^{\top}\).</p>
