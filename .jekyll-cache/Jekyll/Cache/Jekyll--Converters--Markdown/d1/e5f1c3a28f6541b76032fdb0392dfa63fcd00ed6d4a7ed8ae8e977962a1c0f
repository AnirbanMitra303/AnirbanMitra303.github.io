Okay! So my procrastinating soul finally set on to create the Github pages website! I am learning it from <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Jonathan McGlone's blog post</a>. 
It is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, which I have been interested in for quite some time and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It is definitely not the easiest of tasks for me without knowing an ounce of html and css, but I hear that you don't need to be an expert. I know some markdown so that should help me. But it definitely is becoming a rewarding experience. There is so much resource out there that I can learn whatever I need to myself. Fingers crossed!
P.S. I realize that I am writing my first blog, on the day <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2020/">JSM 2020</a> begins!<br /><br />
<em>Edit 1:</em> I realize I am not leaving this post alone and constantly editing it. Well the reason is this one is much more for tracking the work process and it's best kept together. I am trying to make my page smartphone and tablet friendly but haven't figured out how to do it yet. I tried to just download the Jekyll theme from <a href="https://academicpages.github.io/">https://academicpages.github.io/</a>. Although it has all the things like css grid compatibility and mathjax which I will need in future, it will take some time figuring out and I am not sure if I want to spend so much time on that. Maybe I will do it slowly and update the whole website a few months later. Also if I can figure out how to add grid compatibility to css and also use mathjax, I might just be better off with the current simple version. I like things simple and obviously I am not a web-developer. Whoa! are the edits going to be longer than the original post?<br />
<em>Edit 2:</em> I add this final edit of this post today, August 11. My website is now in a good shape. I have succesfully organized the CV page and will try to get started with my first stats blog soon. Feeling accomplished!
