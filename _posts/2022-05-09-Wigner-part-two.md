Nearly a year has passed since I continued writing. I read but exams came and went and other stuff made me too preoccupied to make a coherent write up. By now I have forgotten a lot of what story I wanted to tell. I also run the risk of copying or plagiarising from different sources like Wikipedia, but mainly from OH-RMT. While blogs are supposed to be for sharing one's original thoughts, I think I will give myself a break here and just say that I am writing this to trach myself, and to create a resource for my future self.<br>
