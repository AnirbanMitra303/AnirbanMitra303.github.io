Okay! So my procrastinating soul finally set on to create the Github pages website! I am learning it from [Jonathan McGlone's blog post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) 
It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which I have been interested in for quite some time and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It is definitely not easy for me without knowing an ounce of html and css, but I hear that you don't need to be an expert. I know some markdown so that should help me. Fingers crossed!
I realize that I am writing my first blog, on the day [JSM 2020](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2020/) begins!
