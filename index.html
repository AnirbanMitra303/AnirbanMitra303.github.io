	<h2>Hi there, I'm Anirban Mitra</h2>
	<p align = "justify"><img src="/images/profile_pic.jpg" ALIGN="left" style="display:block" /> 
		I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics, University of Pittsburgh, and <em>almost surely a Statistician</em>.<br>
		My primary research area is Networks, mostly in application to Neuroscience. I am also interested in Graphical Models, Time Series, Signal Processing, Non-parametric Theory, Multivariate Analysis, Experimental Design and Additive Models to name a few.
